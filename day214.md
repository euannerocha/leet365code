# Roet

Roet is a minimal JavaScript UI framework exploring simplicity and control in places where React can feel overkill or too abstract.

## 🚩 Motivation

React is powerful, but often introduces complexity or opacity in small-scale or educational contexts. Roet aims to:

- Offer reactivity **without hooks**
- Build a Virtual DOM **without JSX or transpilation**
- Keep the learning curve minimal and transparent
- Enable direct, explicit rendering logic
- Run with zero build tools or bundlers

## ✨ Planned Features

- ✅ `createElement` (JSX‑like syntax without build step)  
- ✅ A basic Virtual DOM  
- ✅ Simple `render()` to mount UI  
- ⏳ Reactive state objects instead of `useState`  
- ⏳ Manual diffing & patching (virtual DOM reconciliation)  
- ⏳ Conditional rendering and reusable components  
- ⏳ Optional plugin system (routing, state, etc.)

## ❌ Not Planned

- No automatic JSX compilation  
- No class‑based components  
- No complex scheduler or Fiber architecture  
- No opinionated CLI or build system
